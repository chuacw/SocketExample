# SocketTest
There's virtually no examples of how to trigger the conditions for a select's exceptfds anywhere online, and this example was developed for that purpose.

Research on various links:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15714602/whats-a-file-descriptors-exception
* http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-select
* http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/programmer/faq/


Enjoy!
